Before that, many cruel incidents of anti-Chinese sentiment in Indonesia were still fresh in our minds. Perhaps the Indonesian authorities had tried their best to make sure that there was a diagnosis or that there was a diagnosis. Perhaps that was not the focus.

I'm in a dilemma... so I hope that the government can allow some children who are taken care of by their families to stay at home and study for themselves, and for parents who need to work, their children can continue to study, the population is smaller, at least it's safer. My child is also taking the PSLE this year, and I'm also worried that my child will not be you can't stop studying without permission... the school will not accept it. Besides the permission of the government, who would want to be a nobody if he has hair!

Min Loh, Singapore was founded in 1965... since then, while kinship and friendship are still alive, ""Singaporean"" has a clear definition and meaning in terms of ""politics, administration"" and ""nationality""... this is just like the necessity of being loyal to the country -- the most effective and relevant parties insist on, imposing on the born and bred ""national service"" that can not be avoided! many of us were born on this island before the ""founding of the People's Republic"" or did our best to work and build on the island earlier. And during our nation-building years, we steadfastly chose ""Singapore"" as our ""loyal country""... while we are building the nation, we are also committed to the successful establishment of the country -- and with the hands of our fellow countrymen born in Singapore, we naturally become ""natives"" -- natives, native Singaporeans!"

If cloth masks have to be washed more every day (replace two masks), suggest adding a small pot of edible vinegar to wash it. Think of wearing a mask, spraying alcohol or sanitizer, and breathing with a mask attached to your nose. How good is it for the human body to be stained with alcohol or poison every day? Salt and edible vinegar can also kill bacteria! Hanging under the sun is the most effective way to kill germs, and it is a personal opinion."

I really think that a big country of 1.4 billion will be able to make an apology to the international community without having to shoulder the responsibilities of the international community... yes. It is difficult for other countries in the world to do it. China has finally done it. 1.4 billion people spread the virus throughout the world. All countries should give it high praise..."

It should be less than S $8, right? Those who died in the war only accounted for the tip of the iceberg that died from the epidemic. What is the use if people do not have fighter planes?

Today, most of the five cases are those that were previously waiting for the test results. All of them have been isolated and are considered as expected. There is a very important point. Singapore has closed the customs early. Cases of re-infection from China or other countries basically no longer exist. As long as the cases of infection in Singapore are properly controlled, they will not get out of control or become serious. And the medical team is also very strong. One more country has recovered, and has already treated 18 cases, the country outside China with the largest number of people recovering."

439,如果是这样的话，以前没有用马桶的人早就被感染，全世界的人几乎都死光了。 盖上了马桶， 然后要用时再打开，难道细菌就不会冲出来吗？还是因为细菌会有更好的阴暗环境， 而生存的更舒服呢？我是真的不明白。
If this is the case, people who did not use the toilet before would have been infected long ago, and almost all the people in the world would have died. If you cover the toilet, then open it when you need it, will the bacteria not come out? Or is it because bacteria have a better dark environment and are more comfortable to live in? I really don't understand."
440,妳脑残吗，妳应该是为了妳自己把，老是挂嘴边有新加坡人要做这些工吗。妳们是为了贪便宜减少开消才请它们工作。问题是如果真的把病毒传染了全部人那就怎么样，妳能确保没事吗，妳来医吗。妳也有年老的，孩子，家庭想被感染吗。到时后悔就晚了，快要死了。妳太自私，没有良心，妳可以称为新加坡人吗。妳入籍申请中国人民把。
Are you brain-damaged? You should be doing it for yourself. Do you always say that there are Singaporeans who want to do these jobs. You ask them to work because you want to be less greedy and less extravagant. The problem is, if the virus is really transmitted to all people, then what will happen? Can you make sure it's okay? Will you come to the doctor. You also have old people, children, do families want to be infected. By then, it will be too late to regret it, and it will die soon. You are too selfish and have no conscience. Can you call yourself a Singaporean. You can apply to the Chinese people for citizenship."

484,再次令我感到惊讶的是，瓦伦·黄慧婷和林奈特·伍克兰都没有因未能报告黄伟恒犯下的强奸罪而在法庭上……尽管他充分了解该罪行！不举报是犯罪吗？特别是这种严重而可恶的强奸罪？如果此事是由没有VIP连接的外行实施的，那么...他或她将立即被法庭起诉并被定罪！但不是被这样的起诉很好隔离和保护的Valen Huang Huiting和Lynnette Ng Yock Lan ...这要归功于他们的VIP关系，例如将张端Chi博士作为亲戚。
Once again, I was surprised that Warren Huang Huiting and Linnett Wu Crane did not appear in court for failing to report the rape committed by Huang Weiheng... even though he was fully aware of the crime! Is it a crime not to report it? Especially this kind of serious and vicious rape? If this is done by a layman without a VIP connection, then... he or she will be prosecuted and convicted by the court immediately! But Valen Huang Huiting and Lynnett Ng Yock Lan... who were not well isolated and protected by such a lawsuit, owe it to their VIP relationships, such as Dr. Zhang Duan Chi as a relative."
485,敬启者  谨以此函正式通知您，赖昌萌（Innobrace牙齿矫正有限公司）（Spectrum Marine Resources Pte Ltd）（舞蹈学校）（Ristorante Palermo）也被称为Alan Lai，目前正因大规模逃税而受到调查。 1亿美元...而且由于国库又名IRAS而未能缴纳约1500万新元的税款！ 我建议您召回任何未偿还的贷款...上述个人的商品和服务等订单....由于州政府极有可能无法偿还债务...一旦州和IRAS追讨他们的1500万新元...以及逃避上述金额的2倍或3倍的罚款...相当于大约4500万新元至6000万新元！到那时，为时已晚，因为您的公司可能没有剩余的资金或资产要召回。 您可能希望与IRAS核实上述内容的有效性...以及我所主张和提及的针对Lai Chong Meng aka Alan Lai的任何正在进行的调查 希望以上信息对您和您的机构有用
With this letter, I would like to officially inform you that Electric Marine Resources Pte Ltd (dance school), also known as Alan Lai, is currently under investigation for large-scale tax evasion. US $100 million... and you can't pay about S $15 million in taxes because of the state treasury, also known as IRAS! I suggest that you recall any outstanding loans... orders for goods and services of the above mentioned individuals... as there is a high probability that they will not be able to repay their debts... once the states and IRAS recover their S $15 million... and avoid a fine of S $2 or 3 times the above amount... it is equivalent to approximately S $45 million to S $60 million! by then, it will be too late, because your company may not have the remaining funds or assets to recall. You may wish to verify the validity of the above with IRAS... and any ongoing research on Lai Chong Meng aka Alan Lai that I advocate and mention... we hope the above information will be useful to you and your organisation"
